    "A coroutinue is syntactically like a generator: just a function with the `yield` keyword in its body. However in routine, `yield` usually appears on the righ side of an expression (e.g., `datum = yield`), and it may or may not produce a value - if there is no expression after yield keyword, the generator yields None. The coroutine may receive data from the caller, which uses `.send(datum)` instead of `next(...)` to feed the coroutine. Usually, the caller pushes values into the coroutine."
