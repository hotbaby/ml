Classes are first-class object in Python, so a function can be used to create a new class at any time, without using the class keyword. Class decorators are also functions, but capable of inspecting, changing, and even replacing the decorated class with another class. Finnaly, metaclass are the most advanced tool for class metaprogramming; they let you create whole new categories of classes with special traits, such as the abstract base classes we've already seen."
