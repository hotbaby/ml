Out-of-place versions simply allocate new objects and keep references to the old graph, while in-place operations, require changing the creator of all inputs to the `Function` representing this operation. This can be tricky, especailly if there are many Tensors that reference the same storage, and in-place functions will actually raise an error if the storage off modified inputs is referenced by any other `Tensor`."

This ensures that if you're using in-place functions and not seeing any errors, you can be sure that the computed gradients are correct."
